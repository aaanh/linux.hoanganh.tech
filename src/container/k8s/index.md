# Kubernetes ☸️

Explaining kubernetes is a pain, so I'd encourage you to seek out better and more structured crash course on YouTube or something.

- Read this [Kubernetes official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/) for a brief overview.
- Find a diagram about the Kubernetes cluster architecture and components and memorize that.
